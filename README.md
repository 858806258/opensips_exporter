# opensips_exporter 
This exporter exposes OpenSIPS metrics for consumption by Prometheus using the Unix socket 
provided by OpenSIPS. It uses the
OpenSIPS [Management Interface](http://www.opensips.org/Documentation/Interface-MI-1-11) to gather
these statistics.

Tested and developed for OpenSIPS 1.11. Though the Management Interface to gather metrics is available
in other OpenSIPS versions.

### Processors

There are processors available per 'module' of OpenSIPS. The processors take the
statistics from the OpenSIPS socket and turn it into a Prometheus metric. You can 
recognise a processor by the naming convention of the metrics. 
For example the`opensips_core_replies` metric comes from the core module and its 
processor can be found in `./processors/core_processor`.

You can find out more about the available modules in the OpenSIPS documentation.
At this time not all modules have a processor written for them. (help wanted!)

#### Filtering enabled processors

It is possible to select what processors you want metrics from. You can do this by
appending `collect[]` parameters to your request. If for example you only want to
get metrics about the [core](http://www.opensips.org/Documentation/Interface-CoreStatistics-1-11) 
and [usrloc](http://www.opensips.org/html/docs/modules/1.11.x/usrloc.html#idp5699792) 
module you can do this as follows:

```bash
curl localhost:9434/metrics?collect[]=core:&collect[]=usrloc:
```

**_Note: You have to append `:` to the module name for this to work._**

### Development

To work on opensips_exporter, get a recent [Go], get a recent [dep], and
run:

    go get -u github.com/VoIPGRID/opensips_exporter

While developing, make sure to run `dep ensure` often enough to keep
dependencies up-to-date.

The `github.com/VoIPGRID/opensips_exporter/opensips` package contains the
implementation of the interactions with OpenSIPS needed to get statistics from
the mi_datagram Unix socket of a running OpenSIPS. For tests, there is a mock
in the `./internal/mock` package.

Metrics from different OpenSIPS modules are extracted by processors defined in
the `./processors` package. To extend this exporter with metrics from other modules
create your own processor and implement the `Collector` interface. See the other
processors for inspiration.
